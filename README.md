From the basics of tokenization and stemming, to the complexities of sentiment analysis and machine translation, this repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in NLP. So, come along and join me as we dive deep into the world of Natural Language Processing!

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

### 2. Open in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository by selecting `File > Open Folder` from the menu, then choosing the repository folder.

### 3. Set Up Environment

Depending on your preferred environment setup, follow one of the options below:

- **Option 1: Virtual Environment** (recommended):

  - Open a terminal in VS Code by selecting `Terminal > New Terminal` from the menu.
  - Create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module:
    ```
    python -m venv nlp_env
    ```
  - Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```
      .\nlp_env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```
      source nlp_env/bin/activate
      ```

- **Option 2: Conda Environment**:
  - If you're using Anaconda or Miniconda, create a new environment:
    ```
    conda create --name nlp_env python=3.8
    ```
  - Activate the conda environment:
    ```
    conda activate nlp_env
    ```
